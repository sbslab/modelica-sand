# Modelica Sand Heating Package
An open-source Modelica package for silica-sand thermal energy storge (TES) applications in building and district heating systems

## Description
This repository contains a Modelica library for developing and testing heating plants with sand TES.
This includes primary equipment, subsystem assemblies, and controls.

## Setup

### Main Library
This model uses the Modelica Buildings Library Version 9.0.0, which can be downloaded here:
https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/download.html.

LBNL recommends to install the offically released library in a different location than where models
are developed. Their install guide can be seen here: https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/installLibrary.html.
